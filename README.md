## Acknowledgments:

I was inspired by the work done by the [c3se](https://github.com/c3se) team, as showcased in their [repository](https://github.com/c3se/containers/tree/master/rpm-builds). Additionally, I greatly benefited from the advice shared by the community on the EasyBuild Slack and from the [insightful talk](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild/wiki/EasyBuild-tech-talks-I:-Open-MPI) organized by EasyBuild, which can be found on their [Tech Talks](https://easybuild.io/tech-talks/) page.
